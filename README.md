## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture diagram](asset/architecture.jpg)

The main architecture of the code is based on MVI + CLEAN architecture. The division criteria is a hybrid strategy based on Feature + Layer by module.
For the details of architecture, please read [this article](https://medium.com/@kaaveh/migrate-from-mvvm-to-mvi-f938c27c214f).

## Wear OS
This project includes a WearOS module for Android-based smartwatches like the Galaxy Watch. The `app-watch` module contains `app`, `designsystem`, `navigation`, and `ui` submodules. You can build the `app-watch:app` to have a wearOS version of the application.

## üö¶ Navigation

For the details of navigation implementations, please read [this article](https://proandroiddev.com/all-about-navigation-in-the-jetpack-compose-based-production-code-base-902706b8466d).
